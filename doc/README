This is txSMPP, a SMPPv3.4 protocol implementation for use with the Twisted 
framework. By itself, it functions as a black hole, but contains hook 
methods to customize its authorization procedure, add message sources and 
process received messages.

A possible usage is a SMPP outlet in a multiprotocol message gateway, like in
a XMPP-to-SMS or a Email-to-SMS solution.

There is also an interface which can be used to bridge the SMPP server/client
to the data sources. These can be:

— a web form to SMS converter;
— a polling adbapi solution to pick incoming messages from a database;
— an email server with SMTP on the other end;
— an interface to BS, which can make a full-fledged SMSC;
— a bridge to Kannel the SMS and WAP gateway;
— you name it.

The SMPP protocol instance has a notion of "channels". By default, there is
one channel and more can be created. These can be used to limit and prioritize
the bandwidth, a frequent task for SMPP servers and client.

Adapters are ultimately attached to channels; their priority and bandwidth is
equalized between every party in that channel.

Messages received by an adapter comply to email interface and are lazily
decoded to more proper encodings when asked to by email senders (there are
other methods to use them as SMS proper messages if needed that way).

TODO/IDEAS:

* [M] add v5 support, there is not very much to it, but would be handy.
* [L] does anyone want CIMD?
* [L] if a message is not text but an EMS of sorts, it could be decoded to a
      message with an attachment of a PNG image, a MIDI file or AAC/AMR/WAV/
      GSM sound file... cool, isn't it?
* [H] Delivery notifications need their own format. How do we represent them
      as emails? Delivery receipt RFC?
* [H] I dunno if a queue broker should be added. This has proven to be a very
      tricky and demanding thing. Maybe, for now, let's implement very basic
      routing assumptions (if we are a server, there must be a router to tell
      which message goes where).
* [H] It's simple to find out how we channel a client connection. Do we do that
      per user ID? Maybe another reverse-routing factory is needed...
